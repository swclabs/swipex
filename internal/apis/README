The apis package implements APIs following the restful API standard.

The directory includes the following folders:

- controller: handles routing to corresponding services
- middleware: defines middleware for the API
- router: routes endpoints to corresponding controllers

With the `IServer` object, we initialize the engine with the core framework
echo to connect the routers using the `Connect` method.

The outer layer is the Adapter (`types.Adapter`), implemented in the
`main.adapter.go`.We use the `IServer` in the `boot` directory to connect
with the `IServer` of the `apis` directory through the Adapter interface.
